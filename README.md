# ScreenVersionUpdate
Hi, I'm Lacie, an iOS developer.

This is a project about showing AppVersion on screen and update it automatically.

If you like this project, you can press ★Star to follow it.

And if you are good at Chinese, you can see the [article](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10226352) I wrote about the process while doing the project.
